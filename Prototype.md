Looking at your comprehensive MVP architecture, here's a focused 1-2 week prototype plan that demonstrates the core value proposition while laying groundwork for the full system:
Week 1-2 Prototype Plan
Core Value to Validate
"Can AI effectively convert voice recordings into searchable, structured candidate profiles that employers find valuable?"

Week 1: Core Functionality
Day 1-2: Basic Recording & Transcription
python# Single FastAPI endpoint
@app.post("/record")
async def process_recording(file: UploadFile):
    # Save audio file locally
    audio_path = f"./recordings/{file.filename}"
    
    # Transcribe with Whisper API
    transcript = openai.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model="whisper-1",
        file=open(audio_path, "rb")
    )
    
    # Basic structuring with GPT-4
    structured = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        messages=[{
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "Extract: skills, experience level, and key projects"
        }, {
            "role": "user",
            "content": transcript.text
        }]
    )
    
    # Store in SQLite
    return {"id": candidate_id, "profile": structured}
Day 3-4: Simple Search Implementation
python# Use OpenAI embeddings + cosine similarity
@app.post("/search")
async def search_candidates(query: str):
    # Generate query embedding
    query_embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-small",
        input=query
    ).data[0].embedding
    
    # Simple vector search (can use numpy for prototype)
    candidates = simple_vector_search(query_embedding)
    
    return candidates[:5]  # Top 5 matches
Day 5: Basic UI
typescript// Two simple pages
// 1. RecordingPage.tsx
const RecordingPage = () => {
  // Use MediaRecorder API
  // Show real-time feedback
  // Display generated profile after processing
}

// 2. EmployerSearch.tsx  
const EmployerSearch = () => {
  // Natural language input
  // Display candidate cards with AI summaries
  // Show why each candidate matches
}
Week 2: Demo Polish & Validation Features
Day 6-7: Key Differentiators

Add "Why this match?" explanations using GPT-4
Create side-by-side candidate comparison
Generate interview questions based on candidate profiles

Day 8-9: Demo Scenarios

Pre-populate with 10-20 diverse candidate recordings
Create 3-4 specific search scenarios that showcase the AI's capabilities:

"Find me a senior React developer who has built marketplaces"
"Show me candidates with Python and ML experience under $150k"
"Which candidates have the best communication skills?"



Day 10: Deployment & Demo Prep

Deploy on Railway/Render (simple, one-click)
Create demo video showing the full flow
Prepare metrics dashboard showing:

Transcription accuracy
Search relevance scores
Time saved vs traditional screening



What to Prioritize

Core AI Magic ✨

Focus 60% effort on making the AI transcription → structuring → search pipeline work incredibly well
This is your differentiator


Demo-able Scenarios

Create specific, relatable use cases that resonate with startup hiring pain points
Show real time savings and quality improvements


Minimal but Polished UI

Don't build auth, user management, or complex features
Make the two core screens (record & search) feel magical



Validation Metrics to Track
python# Add simple analytics
@app.post("/track_event")
async def track_event(event: dict):
    # Track during demos:
    # - Search queries used
    # - Which candidates they clicked on
    # - Time spent reviewing
    # - Feedback on accuracy
Talking Points for Startup Meetings

The Problem: "You spend hours screening candidates. What if AI could pre-interview them and make them instantly searchable?"
Live Demo: Show the actual prototype:

Record a quick intro
Watch it get processed
Search with natural language
Find exactly what you're looking for


Validation Questions:

"How do you currently screen technical candidates?"
"What % of applicants would you want to hear talk about their experience?"
"Would you trust AI to surface the best matches?"
"What would make this a must-have vs nice-to-have?"



Technical Shortcuts (OK for Prototype)

No authentication - Use URL tokens for demos
SQLite instead of PostgreSQL - Perfectly fine for <100 records
In-memory vector search - NumPy instead of Pinecone
Local file storage - Skip S3 for now
Single server - No need for microservices yet
Synchronous processing - No Celery/queues needed

Code Structure That Scales
Even in the prototype, structure your code to easily expand:
python# services/transcription.py
class TranscriptionService:
    def process(self, audio_file):
        # Start with OpenAI
        # Later: Add Deepgram, AssemblyAI
        pass

# services/search.py  
class SearchService:
    def search(self, query):
        # Start with simple embeddings
        # Later: Add Pinecone, reranking
        pass
Success Criteria
Your prototype is successful if you can:

Demo the full flow in under 5 minutes
Get "wow" reactions on the AI's ability to understand and structure voice data
Hear specific feature requests (validates the core idea)
Get 2-3 startups willing to pilot the full MVP

This approach gets you a working prototype that proves the concept while being architected to scale into your full MVP vision. The key is showing the magic of AI-powered hiring, not building every feature.
