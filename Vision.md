Vision & Go-to-Market Strategy: The AI-Native Hiring Platform
1. Executive Summary
The modern hiring process is broken. It's caught in an AI arms race where candidates use AI to spam hundreds of applications and companies use AI to filter them, creating a system that is noisy, inefficient, and devoid of trust. The fundamental unit of this system—the 2-page resume—was designed for human scanning, not for the AI era.

We are building the first AI-native hiring platform that fundamentally reimagines the application process. We replace the static, keyword-optimized resume with a dynamic, living portfolio of a candidate's project stories, captured through conversation. This shifts the paradigm from compression to context, allowing companies to understand a candidate's true capabilities, not just their ability to write a good resume.

Our immediate wedge into the market is a powerful, quantifiable value proposition: we eliminate the phone screen. By front-loading the deep-dive conversation that normally happens in a 30-minute call, we will save tech startups an average of $16,000 and hundreds of hours for every single technical hire, all while providing richer insights and a better candidate experience.

2. The Problem: The $16,000 Bottleneck and the AI Arms Race
The current state of tech recruiting is a paradox of inefficiency. Despite massive investment in Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and AI tools, the process is slower and more expensive than ever.

The Phone Screen Bottleneck: The average Silicon Valley startup now conducts 20 phone screens to make one technical hire. At a conservative cost of $89-$115 per call (factoring in the interviewer's and recruiter's time), this initial screening step alone costs over $16,000 per hire and consumes hundreds of hours of valuable engineering time.

High Drop-Off & Poor Experience: The tedious scheduling and repetitive nature of phone screens lead to a candidate drop-off rate of up to 73%. Top candidates, who are often passive, are unwilling to jump through low-value hoops.

The Failure of Keywords: Traditional ATS and AI tools rely on keyword matching, a brittle system that filters out high-potential candidates who don't use the "right" jargon. This forces candidates to spend hours tailoring resumes for bots, not humans.

The Trust Deficit: With both sides leveraging undisclosed AI, there is a profound lack of transparency and trust. Employers don't know if they're reading a human's words, and candidates feel they're shouting into a void, judged by opaque algorithms.

3. The Long-Term Vision: From Compression to Context
Our vision is to build the definitive platform for hiring in the AI era by changing the core asset of the application process.

Instead of a resume designed to be compressed, we enable candidates to create a profile built on context.

The Living Profile: Candidates don't write, they talk. They discuss their projects, challenges, and accomplishments in guided conversations on our platform. Our AI transcribes, polishes, and structures this content into a rich, queryable knowledge base. This profile grows and deepens over time, becoming a reusable, authentic representation of their skills.

The Queryable Candidate: Employers no longer scan for keywords. They ask questions. They can query a candidate's entire experience with nuanced, role-specific prompts like:

"Show me examples of how this candidate has scaled a system from 0 to 1."

"What was their specific contribution to the backend architecture of Project X?"

"Describe a time they dealt with conflicting product requirements."

Radical Transparency: Our platform will be the north star for trust. We will provide clear "nutrition labels" on how AI is used to assist both the candidate (e.g., "Transcript polished for clarity") and the employer (e.g., "This summary was generated based on your query").

This creates a flywheel: Richer profiles attract discerning employers. Quality jobs attract top-tier candidates willing to share their stories. The data from these interactions makes our matching AI smarter, creating a powerful, defensible moat.

4. Go-to-Market: The Phone Screen Wedge
A revolutionary vision requires a pragmatic entry point. Our go-to-market strategy is focused on a single, undeniable pain point.

Our Initial Promise: "We will replace every phone screen."

Target Customer: We will initially target Series A, B, and C tech startups in Silicon Valley. These companies are growing fast, feel the pain of hiring acutely, are tech-savvy, and are more willing to adopt innovative solutions than large enterprises.

The Hook: We will lead with the cost savings. By eliminating the need for 20+ phone screens per hire, we offer an immediate and substantial ROI. This isn't a vague promise of "better candidates"; it's a hard-dollar saving on their biggest expense: engineering time.

The "Land and Expand" Model:

Land: We onboard a startup by having them route applications for a single, hard-to-fill role to our platform instead of their standard ATS. We can function as their sole application gateway for that role.

Expand: Once the hiring manager experiences the speed and depth of insight from our platform for one role, we will expand across their entire engineering department and then to other functions like product and design.

Acquiring the First Users: We will start with the employer (demand) side. Candidates will naturally flow to our platform by applying for jobs at the companies we partner with. There is no initial need for a large-scale candidate marketing campaign. Our focus is on B2B sales to a curated list of 50-100 target startups.

5. The MVP: A Step-by-Step Plan
To bring this vision to life, we will follow a lean, iterative 12-week plan focused on validation and execution speed.

Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Secure 3 paying design partners.

Action: Conduct intensive customer discovery interviews with 20 VPs of Engineering and CTOs at target startups. Validate the $16k pain point and get firm commitments from a few to pilot the platform.

Phase 2: Build the Core Experience (Weeks 3-8)

Goal: Build a functional MVP that delivers the "magic moment."

Candidate MVP: A simple web interface where a candidate can be prompted to record a 10-15 minute story about a key project. The platform will use Whisper API for transcription and a Large Language Model (LLM) for clean-up and structuring. The candidate can review and approve the final text.

Employer MVP: A dashboard where the hiring manager can see the transcribed stories of applicants and use a simple search bar to ask natural language questions about the candidate's experience.

Phase 3: Pilot & Iterate (Weeks 9-12)

Goal: Have the first hire made through the platform without a phone screen.

Action: Onboard the 3 design partners. Route their live job applications through our system. Work with them daily to gather feedback, measure time saved, and iterate on the product. Track user metrics (time-to-shortlist) and AI metrics (query relevance) obsessively.

This focused plan mitigates the classic "chicken-and-egg" marketplace problem by starting with the paying customer and delivering immediate, quantifiable value.
